# What's this ?
My .nvim folder with every plugin I use and my own annotated init.vim file

# Requirements

- neovim >=0.5
- GNU make
- nodejs (Optional but highly recommended, for javascript/typescript support, typescript, and prettier)

# Installation

- Clone this repo anywhere (I use it as a submodule in my [init-environment repo](https://github.com/stephanetrebel/init-environment), for instance).
- Use GNU make:

```bash
$ make install
```

- For Typescript, install typescript globally (`npm install -g typescript`) so that Coc can use it. You can also rely on a locally installed (project based) typescript but to benefit from all the tsserver API I find it better to consistently use a global one.
- For Prettier automatic formatting, install prettier globally (`npm install -g prettier`)
- Don't forget to review the init.vim file ! I took some time to comment why I added stuff here and there's a lot of little things so feel free to own the file. That's what Vim is about after all: owning your editor :)
- Remember that `:help` is your friend. If you don't understand a setting, or a command, just `:help` it !

Enjoy !
